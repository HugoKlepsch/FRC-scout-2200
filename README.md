# Description

2200 Scouting is a utility that helps collect scouting data for First
Robotics Competition (FRC) matches.
Count how many game pieces are scored or objectives achieved during each phase
of the match, then convert that data into a QR code for easy entry into a
scouting spreadsheet.

The QR code is a tab delimited list of the scoring attributes, so any QR code
reader that enters the data as a keyboard is supported; just ensure that the
columns are set up to match the output.
